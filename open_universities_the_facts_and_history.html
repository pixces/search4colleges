        <h1>Open Universities, the facts and history</h1>

		<p>The term Open University began in Great Britain to describe a University or college, which is open to people without formal education or qualifications. Teaching is accomplished through correspondence, broadcasting, or summer school.  The term open University is now synonymous with online education.  Open universities usually have liberal admissions policies that feature external degree  programs and use nontraditional course delivery methods, such as telecourses, online education, and Internet student forums.  Today the nontraditional is becoming traditional as tuition costs rise.</p>
		<p><strong>History</strong></p>
		<p>Distance education dates back to 1728, when &quot;an advertisement in the Boston Gazette, ran feature ads from a teacher named Caleb Phillips, professor of the new method of Short Hand who was seeking students for lessons to be sent weekly through the mail.  Modern distance education initially relied on the development of efficient postal services in the 19th century. Distance learning has been practiced on a regular basis dating back to 1840 when Isaac Pitman taught shorthand in Great Britain via correspondence.  The University of London claims to be the first University to offer distance learning degrees in the early 1860s.</p>
        <p>In the U.S. William Rainey Harper who was the first president of the University of Chicago developed the concept of extended education, whereby the school had satellite colleges throughout the community. Columbia University formalized the concept of correspondence education in the middle 1870s.</p>
        <p>In the twentieth century Charles Wedemeyer of the University of Wisconsin located in Madison established the first technology based delivery for correspondence courses. Dr. Wedemeyer through funding from the Carnegie Foundationâ€™s instructional media project, funded broadcasts, which could be viewed on public television stations throughout the United States. In the middle 1960s few televisions had UHF receivers, which limited the audience for this new learning delivery method. Channel 28 located in Los Angeles aired the distance learning broadcasts as a part of early morning television during the mid 1960s.</p>
        <p>During the 1970s, 80s, and early 1990s recordings and video cassettes were the most common course delivery methods for distance learners.</p>
        <p>Open or online education over the Internet is creating new opportunities for higher education, students  who would never have had the chance to attend a college or university can attend school from the comfort of their home.  Online education is growing very rapidly and it is important schools follow a set of high standards concerning how they deliver courses taught to students.</p>
